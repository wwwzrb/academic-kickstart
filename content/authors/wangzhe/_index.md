I am a first year PhD student at the ANL Lab of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests include wireless communication, data center networks and AI. I am supervised by Prof. Linghe Kong and Prof. Guihai Chen from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/)  of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I also work closely with Prof. Liang He from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.ucdenver.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering)  of University of Colorado Denver.
