abstract: As wireless communication is tailored for low-power devices while the number of Internet of Things is growing exponentially, the collision problem in ZigBee is worsen. The classical approaches of solving collision problems lie in collision avoidance and packet retransmission, which could incur considerable overhead. The new trend is to decompose multipacket collision directly, however, the high bit error rate limits its practical applications.
